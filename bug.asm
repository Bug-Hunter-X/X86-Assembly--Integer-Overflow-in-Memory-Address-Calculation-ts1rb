mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4]

This instruction attempts to access memory using an address calculated as the sum of the EBX register and the product of ECX and 4.  The bug arises if ECX is sufficiently large to cause an integer overflow when multiplied by 4. This overflow leads to an incorrect effective address, resulting in accessing unintended memory locations or a segmentation fault.
